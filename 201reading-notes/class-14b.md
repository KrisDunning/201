# Reading 14 - What Google Learned About Teams

*****

The articles subject, Julia Rozovsky, noticed that two different teams of people had two different dynamics at college and when they graduated they joined "Project Aristotle" at Google.  

Studies have shown that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. The studies also showed that teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.  

The problem was *how* could Google create a perfect team and what factors played into the desired outcome.  

Project Aristotle reviewed academic studies from over half a century and conducted research on 180 teams from all over Google.  

They were unable to make any significant findings that showed a strong link to specific factors that indicated a successfull team.  

One area of research that tended to pop up repeatedly was research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as "**group norms**". Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.  

The research team went looking for instances when team members described a behavior as an "unwritten rule" or when they explained things as part of the "team's culture". After looking at the groups for over a year Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google's teams. But now they needed to figure out which norms mattered most.  

In 2008, a group of psychologists from Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T and Union College attempted to measure a groups intelligence much like an individuals intelligence.  

Researchers concluded that what distinguished "good" teams from dysfunctional teams was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, could raise a group's collective intelligence.  

They also noticed two behaviors that all good teams had.  

- 1) Members spoke in roughly the same proportions.  
- 2) The team had high "average social sensitivity" or ability to intuit how others felt based on their tone of voice, expressions, or other nonverbal clues.

These two traits are part of whats known as psychological safety. A shared belief held by members that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.  

To figure out how to implement a new way to foster these elements in teams they released the info to some google employees to see if any ideas would be created.  

They researched, tied data into the desired outcome and allowed their teams to implement the neccessary adjustments for their teams. They had data and terminology to verbalize how things are and how they could be.
